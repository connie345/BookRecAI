The others were listening to Brady\\'sdescription of traffic congestion at the Rush Street bridge during therush hour at night. The fire crackled cheerily. The owners of theyellow-green eyes raised their frightful chorus to the heavens.Conditions seemed again to have returned to normal. And then, asthough the hand of Death had reached out and touched them all, the fivemen tensed into sudden rigidity.Above the nocturnal diapason of the teeming jungle sounded a dismalflapping of wings and over head, through the thick night, a shadowyform passed across the diffused light of the flaring camp-fire.Sinclair raised his rifle and fired. An eerie wail floated down fromabove and the apparition, whatever it might have been, was swallowed bythe darkness. For several seconds the listening men heard the sound ofthose dismally flapping wings lessening in the distance until theycould no longer be heard.Bradley was the first to speak. \"Shouldn\\'t have fired, Sinclair,\" hesaid; \"can\\'t waste ammunition.\" But there was no note of censure inhis tone. It was as though he understood the nervous reaction that hadcompelled the other\\'s act.\"I couldn\\'t help it, sir,\" said Sinclair. \"Lord, it would take an ironman to keep from shootin\\' at that awful thing. Do you believe inghosts, sir?\"\"No,\" replied Bradley. \"No such things.\"\"I don\\'t know about that,\" said Brady. \"There was a woman murderedover on the prairie near Brighton--her throat was cut from ear to ear,and--\"\"Shut up,\" snapped Bradley.\"My grandaddy used to live down Coppington wy,\" said Tippet. \"Theywere a hold ruined castle on a \\'ill near by, hand at midnight they usedto see pale blue lights through the windows an \\'ear--\"\"Will you close your hatch!\" demanded Bradley. \"You fools will haveyourselves scared to death in a minute. Now go to sleep.\"But there was little sleep in camp that night until utter exhaustionovertook the harassed men toward morning; nor was there any return ofthe weird creature that had set the nerves of each of them on edge.The following forenoon the party reached the base of the barrier cliffsand for two days marched northward in an effort to discover a break inthe frowning abutment that raised its rocky face almost perpendicularlyabove them, yet nowhere was there the slightest indication that thecliffs were scalable.Disheartened, Bradley determined to turn back toward the fort, as healready had exceeded the time decided upon by Bowen Tyler and himselffor the expedition. The cliffs for many miles had been trending in anortheasterly direction, indicating to Bradley that they wereapproaching the northern extremity of the island. According to thebest of his calculations they had made sufficient easting during thepast two days to have brought them to a point almost directly north ofFort Dinosaur and as nothing could be gained by retracing their stepsalong the base of the cliffs he decided to strike due south through theunexplored country between them and the fort.That night (September 9, 1916), they made camp a short distance fromthe cliffs beside one of the numerous cool springs that are to be foundwithin Caspak, oftentimes close beside the still more numerous warm andhot springs which feed the many pools. After supper the men laysmoking and chatting among themselves. Tippet was on guard. Fewernight prowlers threatened them, and the men were commenting upon thefact that the farther north they had traveled the smaller the number ofall species of animals became, though it was still present in whatwould have seemed appalling plenitude in any other part of the world.The diminution in reptilian life was the most noticeable change in thefauna of northern Caspak. Here, however, were forms they had not metelsewhere, several of which were of gigantic proportions.According to their custom all, with the exception of the man on guard,sought sleep early, nor, once disposed upon the ground for slumber,were they long in finding it. It seemed to Bradley that he hadscarcely closed his eyes when he was brought to his feet, wide awake,by a piercing scream which was punctuated by the sharp report of arifle from the direction of the fire where Tippet stood guard. As heran toward the man, Bradley heard above him the same uncanny wail thathad set every nerve on edge several nights before, and the dismalflapping of huge wings.

Who could approve more of such a law than you, honestHunston?\"\"Who, indeed?\"Hunston winced under the cool scrutiny of the Greek.Did he know aught about what had taken place?The idea was utterly absurd.He (Hunston) had taken too much care that he was not observed for anyvulgar pryer like Boulgaris to find a corner from which to spy upon hismovements.Still it gave him a qualm.\"Quite right,\" said Hunston, boldly; \"quite right and just; any man whocan play false to his fellows deserves to die the death.\"\"Hear, hear! Let him die.\"\"And the two boys shall die with him?\" asked Boulgaris.\"They shall, at daybreak.\"This was put to the assembled throng, and agreed to by all, whensuddenly a single dissentient voice was heard.\"They shall not die.\"The brigands looked up, and a boy appeared upon the scene, the boy whohad lured the luckless lads to their present unlucky pitch.\"Theodora.\"\"Aye, Theodora,\" responded the boy--or rather girl--for a girl it was,as you have long since discovered, although in male attire.\"And why shall they not die, Theodora?\" asked Hunston.\"Ask rather why they should die?\" she said sadly. \"What have they doneto merit death?\"\"Hullo, hullo!\" ejaculated Toro.\"Why, whatever is the meaning of this change of tone?

The child istoo young to be shocked at death, and will suppose she is asleep.But you will be able to see if he recognizes her.\"There was no doubt as to the recognition. The child started interror, when he saw the woman lying in the shed into which she hadbeen carried. It checked its first impulse to cry out, butstruggled to get further off.\"Moder asleep,\" he said, in a whisper. \"If she wake, she beatBilly.\"That was enough. The woman carried him back to the house.\"She\\'s his mother, sir, sure enough,\" she said to the master,\"though how she should be puzzles me. She is dressed in prettydecent clothes; but she is as dark as a gypsy, with black hair.This child is fair, with a skin as white as milk, now he iswashed.\"\"I daresay he takes after his father,\" the master--who was apractical man--said. \"I hear that there is no name on her things,no paper or other article which would identify her in her pockets;but there is two pounds, twelve shillings in her purse, so she wasnot absolutely in want. It will pay the parish for her funeral.\"An hour later the guardians assembled and, upon hearing thecircumstances of the newcomer\\'s admission, and the death of thetramp, they decided that the child should be entered in the booksas \"William Gale,\"--the name being chosen with a reference to theweather during which he came into the house--and against his name anote was written, to the effect that his mother--a tramp, nameunknown--had, after leaving him at the door of the workhouse, beenfound frozen to death next day.William Gale grew, and throve. He was a quiet and contented child;accustomed to be shut up all day alone, while his mother was outwashing, the companionship of other children in the workhouse was apleasant novelty and, if the food was not such as a dainty childwould fancy, it was at least as good as he had been accustomed to.The porter\\'s wife continued to be the fast friend of the child whomshe had saved from death. The fact that she had done so gave her aninterest in it. Her own children were out in service, or at work inthe fields; and the child was a pleasure to her. Scarce a daypassed, then, that she would not go across the yard up to theinfants\\' ward, and bring Billy down to the lodge; where he wouldplay contentedly by the hour, or sit watching her, and sucking at acake, while she washed or prepared her husband\\'s dinner.Billy was seldom heard to cry. Perhaps he had wept all his stock oftears away, before he entered the house. He had seldom fits of badtemper, and was a really lovable child. Mrs. Dickson never waveredin the opinion she had first formed--that the dead tramp was notBilly\\'s mother--but as no one else agreed with her, she kept herthoughts to herself.The years passed on, and William Gale was now no longer in theinfants\\' ward, but took his place in the boys\\' school. Here he atonce showed an intelligence beyond that of the other boys of hisown age. The hours which he had, each day, spent in the porter\\'slodge had not been wasted. The affection of the good woman hadbrightened his life, and he had none of the dull, downcast look socommon among children in workhouses. She had encouraged him to talkand play, had taught him the alphabet, and supplied him with anoccasional picture book, with easy words. Indeed, she devoted farmore time to him than many mothers, in her class of life, can giveto their children.The guardians, as they went in and out to board meeting, woulddelight her by remarking:\"That is really a fine little fellow, Mrs. Dickson. He really doesyou credit. A fine, sturdy, independent little chap.\"The child, of course, wore the regular uniform of workhousechildren; but Mrs. Dickson--who was handy with her needle--used tocut and alter the clothes to fit him, and thus entirely changedtheir appearance.\"He looks like a gentleman\\'s child,\" one of the guardians said, oneday.\"I believe he is a gentleman\\'s child, sir.

The horseshowed signs of impatience, shook his head, and eyed Jack in anunfriendly manner.\"He thinks it time to be going,\" thought Jack. \"So do I. I wonder whatthe man\\'s up to. Perhaps he\\'s spending the day.\"Fifteen minutes more passed, but then relief came. The owner of thecarriage came out.\"Did you get tired of waiting for me?\" he asked.\"No,\" said Jack, shrewdly. \"I knew the longer the job, the bigger thepay.\"\"I suppose that is a hint,\" said the gentleman, not offended.\"Perhaps so,\" said Jack, and he smiled too.\"Tell me, now, what are you going to do with the money I give you--buycandy?\"\"No,\" answered Jack, \"I shall carry it home to my mother.\"\"That\\'s well.

It\\'s on account of the panic, Isuppose.\"\"Very likely. He has plenty of company just now.\"It may be remarked that our story opens in the year 1867, memorable forits panic, and the business depression which followed. Nearly everybranch of industry suffered, and thousands of men were thrown out ofwork, and utterly unable to find employment of any kind. Among them wasTimothy Harding, the father of our hero. He was a sober, steady man, andindustrious; but his wages had never been large, and he had been unableto save up a reserve fund, on which to draw in time of need. He had anexcellent wife, and but one child--our present hero; but there wasanother, and by no means unimportant member of the family. This wasRachel Harding, a spinster of melancholy temperament, who belonged tothat unhappy class who are always prophesying evil, and expecting theworst. She had been \"disappointed\" in early life, and this had somethingto do with her gloomy views, but probably she was somewhat inclined bynature to despondency.The family lived in a humble tenement, which, however, was neatly kept,and would have been a cheerful home but for the gloomy presence of AuntRachel, who, since her brother had been thrown out of employment, wasgloomier than ever.But all this while we have left Jack and the stranger standing in thestreet.\"You seem to be a good boy,\" said the latter, \"and, under thecircumstances, I will pay you more than I intended.\"He drew from his vest pocket a dollar bill, and handed it to Jack.\"What! is all this for me?\" asked Jack, joyfully.\"Yes, on the condition that you carry it home, and give it to yourmother.\"\"That I will,', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.848224601625541)]\n"

His slaves had taken the garlands of roses and poplar leavesfrom his brow and breast, and robed him in his night-dress; now, with asilver lamp in his hand, he was approaching his bedroom, and he smiled,for his young wife was awaiting him, the mother of his Hermas. She wasfair and he loved her well, and he had brought home witty sayings torepeat to her from the table of the emperor. He, if any one, had a rightto smile. Now he was in the ante-room, in which two slave-women wereaccustomed to keep watch; he found only one, and she was sleepingand breathing deeply; he still smiled as he threw the light upon herface--how stupid she looked with her mouth open! An alabaster lamp sheda dim light in the bed-room, softly and still smiling he went up toGlycera\\'s ivory couch, and held up his lamp, and stared at the empty andundisturbed bed--and the smile faded from his lips. The smile of thatevening came back to him no more through all the long years, for Glycerahad betrayed him, and left him--him and her child. All this had happenedtwenty years since, and to-day all that he had then felt had returned tohim, and he saw his wife\\'s empty couch with his \"mind\\'s eye,\" as plainlyas he had then seen it, and he felt as lonely and as miserable as inthat night. But now a shadow appeared before the opening of the cave,and he breathed a deep sigh as he felt himself released from the hideousvision, for he had recognized Paulus, who came up and knelt down besidehim.\"Water, water!\" Stephanus implored in a low voice, and Paulus, who wascut to the heart by the moaning of the old man, which he had not heardtill he entered the cave, seized the pitcher. He looked into it, and,finding it quite dry, he rushed down to the spring as if he were runningfor a wager, filled it to the brim and brought it to the lips of thesick man, who gulped the grateful drink down with deep draughts, and atlast exclaimed with a sigh of relief; \"That is better; why were you solong away? I was so thirsty!\" Paulus who had fallen again on his kneesby the old man, pressed his brow against the couch, and made no reply.Stephanus gazed in astonishment at his companion, but perceiving thathe was weeping passionately he asked no further questions. Perfectstillness reigned in the cave for about an hour; at last Paulus raisedhis face, and said, \"Forgive me Stephanus. I forgot your necessityin prayer and scourging, in order to recover the peace of mind I hadtrifled away--no heathen would have done such a thing!\" The sick manstroked his friend\\'s arm affectionately; but Paulus murmured, \"Egoism,miserable egoism guides and governs us. Which of us ever thinks of theneeds of others? And we--we who profess to walk in the way of the Lamb!\"He sighed deeply, and leaned his head on the sick man\\'s breast, wholovingly stroked his rough hair, and it was thus that the senator foundhim, when he entered the cave with Hermas.The idle way of life of the anchorites was wholly repulsive to his viewsof the task for men and for Christians, but he succored those whom hecould, and made no enquiries about the condition of the sufferer. Thepathetic union in which he found the two men touched his heart, and,turning to Paulus, he said kindly: \"I can leave you in perfect comfort,for you seem to me to have a faithful nurse.\"The Alexandrian reddened; he shook his head, and replied: \"I? I thoughtof no one but myself, and left him to suffer and thirst in neglect, butnow I will not quit him--no, indeed, I will not, and by God\\'s help andyours, he shall recover.\"Petrus gave him a friendly nod, for he did not believe in theanchorite\\'s self-accusation, though he did in his good-will; andbefore he left the cave, he desired Hermas to come to him early on thefollowing day to give him news of his father\\'s state.

I fled fromthe world to this mountain, and the world has pursued me and has flungits snares round my feet. I must seek a lonelier waste in which I may bealone--quite alone with my God and myself. There, perhaps I may findthe way I seek, if indeed the fact that the creature that I call \\'I,\\' inwhich the whole world with all its agitations in little finds room--andwhich will accompany me even there--does not once again frustrate all mylabor. He who takes his Self with him into the desert, is not alone.\"Paulus sighed deeply and then pursued his reflections: \"How puffed upwith pride I was after I had tasted the Gaul\\'s rods in place of Hermas,and then I was like a drunken man who falls down stairs step by step.And poor Stephanus too had a fall when he was so near the goal! Hefailed in strength to forgive, and the senator who has just now left me,and whose innocent son I had so badly hurt, when we parted forgivinglygave me his hand. I could see that he did forgive me with all his heart,and this Petrus stands in the midst of life, and is busy early and latewith mere worldly affairs.\"For a time he looked thoughtfully before him, and then he went on in hissoliloquy, \"What was the story that old Serapion used to tell? In theThebaid there dwelt a penitent who thought he led a perfectly saintlylife and far transcended all his companions in stern virtue. Oncehe dreamed that there was in Alexandria a man even more perfect thanhimself; Phabis was his name, and he was a shoemaker, dwelling in theWhite road near the harbor of Kibotos. The anchorite at once went tothe capital and found the shoemaker, and when he asked him, \\'How do youserve the Lord? How do you conduct your life?\\' Phabis looked at him inastonishment. \\'I? well, my Saviour! I work early and late, and providefor my family, and pray morning and evening in few words for the wholecity.\\' Petrus, it seems to me, is such an one as Phabis; but many roadslead to God, and we--and I--\"Again a cold shiver interrupted his meditation, and as morningapproached the cold was so keen that he endeavored to light a fire.While he was painfully blowing the charcoal Hermas came up to him.He had learned from Polykarp\\'s escort where Paulus was to be found, andas he stood opposite his friend he grasped his hand, stroked hisrough hair and thanked him with deep and tender emotion for the greatsacrifice he had made for him when he had taken upon himself thedishonoring punishment of his fault.Paulus declined all pity or thanks, and spoke to Hermas of his fatherand of his future, until it was light, and the young man prepared to godown to the oasis to pay the last honors to the dead. To his entreatythat he would accompany him, Paulus only answered:\"No--no; not now, not now; for if I were to mix with men now I shouldfly asunder like a rotten wineskin full of fermenting wine; a swarm ofbees is buzzing in my head, and an ant-hill is growing in my bosom. Gonow and leave me alone.\"After the funeral ceremony Hermas took an affectionate leave ofAgapitus, Petrus, and Dorothea, and then returned to the Alexandrian,with whom he went to the cave where he had so long lived with his deadfather.There Paulus delivered to him his father\\'s letter to his uncle, andspoke to him more lovingly than he had ever done before. At night theyboth lay down on their beds, but neither of them found rest or sleep.From time to time Paulus murmured in a low voice, but in tones of keenanguish, \"In vain--all in vain--\" and again, \"I seek, I seek--but whocan show me the way?\"They both rose before daybreak; Hermas went once more down to the well,knelt down near it, and felt as though he were bidding farewell to hisfather and Miriam.Memories of every kind rose up in his soul, and so mighty is theglorifying power of love that the miserable, brown-skinned shepherdessMiriam seemed to him a thousand-fold more beautiful than that splendidwoman who filled the soul of a great artist with delight.Shortly after sunrise Paulus conducted him to the fishing-port, and tothe', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8453922185575224)]\n"
